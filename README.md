# decrypt-name-puzzle
A short python program to solve a logical puzzle connecting names to numbers.

The puzzle asks to find a unique assignment of numbers (0-9) for the letters in the following equation:

DONALD + GERALD = ROBERT

where D is known to be 5. I recommend trying to solve it yourself first!
